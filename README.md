# Currency-Momentum-Effects-and-Strategies
This code analyzes data of 21 currencies between 2000 and 2022 to assess the presence of
momentum effects in currency markets. The results show the existence of momentum effects,
especially for brief holding periods, although the explanatory power is limited. Anyhow, the
profitability of momentum portfolios in real-world applications may be restricted by practical
issues like transaction costs and market inefficiencies, despite historically extraordinary
profits.
